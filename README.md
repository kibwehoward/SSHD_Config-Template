# sshd_config

### Template for preferred Linux/ UNIX sshd_config - OpenSSH SSH daemon configuration file settings.

"sshd(8) reads configuration data from /etc/ssh/sshd_config (or the file specified with -f on the command line). The file contains keyword-argument pairs, one per line. Lines starting with '#' and empty lines are interpreted as comments. Arguments may optionally be enclosed in double quotes (") in order to represent arguments containing spaces."
